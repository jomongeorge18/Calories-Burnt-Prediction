# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
This ML project uses the XGBoost Regressor model to predict the number of calories you would burn during a specific duration of exercise. The model takes into account various parameters such as your body weight, height, body temperature, average heart rate, and the duration of exercising. 
XGBoost is a powerful algorithm for gradient boosting that is used for regression predictive modeling.
